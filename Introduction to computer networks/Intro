Network : 

	Group of devices connected to share information
	Can send and receive information like pdf, images, audio, video
Example : whatsapp group

The devices connected in a network can share information and resources (printers, storage or shared internet connection)

How it works ?

Devices like computer, phone are like the people in your whatsapp group.
The connections like wifi and internet is how they talk to each other
The rules are like the language, everyone can understand so the communication works properly.
Example: hindi person, tamil person, telugu people Here English works as protocol so everyone can communicate and understands

Benefits :

Resource sharing : Allows multiple devices or users to access shared resource such as files, printers, or databases over n/w, optimizing resource utilization and reducing redundancy
Load Balancing: It comes in when there is network traffic or computational tasks across multiple servers or devices to ensure efficient utilization, prevent bottle necks and enhance system performance (one server cannot manage n/w traffic so it will distribute among various servers in different locations)                 
High Reliability: Ensures consistent and dependable operation by incorporating fault tolerance, redundancy and failover mechanisms to minimize downtime and data loss.
Location Independence: without needing to know the physical location of the resource, promoting seamless and flexible connectivity


Transmission mode:
How the data is being transferred, this is when the transmission mode comes in
3 Different Modes :

Simplex : one device is allowed to share information another device can only receive the info - Example : TV
Half Duplex : Both the device can send the data but not at the same time so both can act as receiver and transmitter at different time 't' - Example - walkie talkie
Full Duplex :  Both the device can send the data at the same time so both can act as receiver and transmitter. - Example - Cell Phone
