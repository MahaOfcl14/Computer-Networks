Classification of N/w based on coverage Area :

	Classified based on the Geographical area and speed.



1 LAN - Local Area Network:

enables communication b/w confined geographical area
Example - college wifi, residence
Covers small geographical area
High speed data transfer and low cost set-up
Example - office n/w connecting desktop and printers
Types : 
Wireless Lan - Wifi
Wired Lan - Ethernet hub	


2 MAN- Metropolitan Area Network:

Enables communication b/w geographical region roughly the size of metropolitan city
Operates by connecting different LAN's
Faster than WAN broader than LAN
MAN device includes switches/hub or routers/bridges


3 WAN - Wide Area Network

Covers large area
WAN operates by connecting different type of LAN's and MAN's 
Speed is low compared to LAN and MAN


4 PAN - Personal Area Network

Operates within a very limited area like few meters and is designed for personal use
Pan range from 1 to 10 meters for individual use.
Example connection of smartphone in earbuds, Hotspot 


Interconnected Network:

Linking together different types of n/w such as LAN, MAN, WAN, PAN
This integration allows to communicate and share resources smoothly even across vast geographical distances
It uses devices like routers, gateways that help to connect and translate data b/w different n/w's
Merits:

Scalability - easy to expand by connecting new device/network
Improved Communication - Instant communication across networks


Demerits:

Latency - Data transfers across n/w may cause delay
Security Risk - Interconnected so there may be risk of security breaches and attacks.
